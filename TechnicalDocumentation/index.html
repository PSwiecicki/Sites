                <h2 id="what-you-should">What you should already know</h2>
                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ui>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>.</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
                </ui>

                <h2 id="where-to-find">Where to find JavaScript information</h2>
                <p>The JavaScript documentation on MDN includes the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn Web Development provides information for beginners and introduces basic concepts of programming and the Internet.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript Guide (this guide) provides an overview about the JavaScript language and its objects.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript Reference provides detailed reference material for JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are new to JavaScript, start with the articles in the learning area and the JavaScript Guide. Once you have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, you can use the JavaScript Reference to get more details on individual objects and statements.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 id="what-is-javascript">What is JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <strong><mark>Array</mark></strong>, <strong><mark>Date</mark></strong>, and <strong><mark>Math</mark></strong>, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Client-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>. For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li><em>Server-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="js-and-java">JavaScript and Java</h2>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
                <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>
                <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.</p>

                <h2 id="js-and-ecmascript">JavaScript and the ECMAScript specification</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is standardized at Ecma International — the European association for standardizing information and communication systems (ECMA was formerly an acronym for the European Computer Manufacturers Association) to deliver a standardized, international programming language based on JavaScript. This standardized version of JavaScript, called <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script, behaves the same way in all applications that support the standard. Companies can use the open standard language to develop their implementation of JavaScript. The <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script standard is documented in the <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>-262 specification. See New in JavaScript to learn more about different versions of JavaScript and <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script specification editions.</p>
                <p>The <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>-262 standard is also approved by the <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> as ISO-16262. You can also find the specification on the <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr> International website. The <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script specification does not describe the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>, which is standardized by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group">WHATWG</abbr>. The <abbr title="Documeny Object Model">DOM</abbr> defines the way in which <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document objects are exposed to your script. To get a better idea about the different technologies that are used when programming with JavaScript, consult the article JavaScript technologies overview.</p>
                
                <h3 id="js-doc-and-ecmascript-spec">JavaScript documentation versus the <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script specification</h3>
                <p>The <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script specification is a set of requirements for implementing <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script. It is useful if you want to implement standards-compliant language features in your ECMAScript implementation or engine (such as SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or V8 in Chrome).</p>
                <p>The <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script document is not intended to help script programmers. Use the JavaScript documentation for information when writing scripts.</p>
                <p>The <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script specification uses terminology and syntax that may be unfamiliar to a JavaScript programmer. Although the description of the language may differ in <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script, the language itself remains the same. JavaScript supports all functionality outlined in the <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script specification.</p>
                <p>The JavaScript documentation describes aspects of the language that are appropriate for a JavaScript programmer.</p>

                <h2 id="getting-started-with-js">Getting started with JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. This guide includes some JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest versions of Firefox, so using the most recent version of Firefox is recommended.</p>
                <p>The Web Console tool built into Firefox is useful for experimenting with JavaScript; you can use it into two modes: single-line input mode, and multi-line input mode.</p>
                
                <h3 id="single-line-input">Single-line input in the Web Console</h3>
                <p>The Web Console shows you information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a JavaScript interpreter that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.</p>
                <p>To open the Web Console (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> on Mac), open the <strong>Tools</strong> menu in Firefox, and select <strong>"Developer&nbsp;▶&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Console"</strong>.</p>
                <p>The Web Console appears at the bottom of the browser window. Along the bottom of the console is an input line that you can use to enter JavaScript, and the output appears in the panel above:</p>
                <img src="Images/SingleLineInput.png" alt="Single line input in brownser console example">
                <p>The console works the exact same way as eval: the last expression entered is returned. For the sake of simplicity, it can be imagined that every time something is entered into the console, it is actually surrounded by console.log around eval, like so:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">greetMe</span>(<span class="variable">yourName</span>) {
    <span class="function">alert</span>(<span class="string">"Hello "</span> + <span class="variable">yourName</span>)
}
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="function">eval</span>(<span class="string">'3 + 5'</span>))</pre>
                </code>
                <h3 id="multi-line-input">Multi-line input in the Web Console</h3>
                <p>The single-line input mode of the Web Console is great for quick testing of JavaScript expressions, but although you can execute multiple lines, it's not very convenient for that. For more complex JavaScript, you can use the multi-line line input mode.</p>

                <h3 id="hello-world">Hello world</h3>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
(<span class="keyword">function</span>(){
    <span class="string">"use strict"</span>;
    <span class="comment">/* Start of your code */</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">greetMe</span>(<span class="variable">yourName</span>) {
        <span class="function">alert</span>(<span class="string">'Hello '</span> + <span class="variable">yourName</span>);
    }

    <span class="function">greetMe</span>(<span class="string">'World'</span>);
    <span class="comment">/* End of your code */</span>
})();</pre>
                </code>
                <p>Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (or click the Run button) to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
                <p>In the following pages, this guide introduces you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be able to write more complex applications.</p>
                <p>But for now, remember to always include the <span class="code">(<span class="keyword">function</span>(){<span class="string">"use strict"</span>;</span> before your code, and add <span class="code">})();</span> to the end of your code. The strict mode and IIFE articles explain what those do, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prevent semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners.</li>
                    <li>Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g., having something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is <strong>case-sensitive</strong> and uses the <strong>Unicode</strong> character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
let Früh = "foobar"</pre>
                </code>
                <p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
                <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
                <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.</p>
                <aside>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more information, see the detailed reference about JavaScript's lexical grammar.)</p>
                </aside>
                <p>It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
                <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
                <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">// a one line comment

/* this is a longer,
 * multi-line comment
 */
                        
/* You can't, however, /* nest comments */</span> SyntaxError */</pre>
                </code>
                <p>Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.</p>
                <aside>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You might also see a third type of comment syntax at the start of some JavaScript files, which looks something like this:<br> #!/usr/bin/env node.</p>
                    <p>This is called hashbang comment syntax, and is a special comment used to specify the path to a particular JavaScript engine that should execute the script. See Hashbang comments for more details.</p>
                </aside>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 id="declarations">Declarations</h2>
                <p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><span class="keyword inline-code">var</span></dt>
                    <dd>Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</dd>
                    <dt><span class="keyword inline-code">let</span></dt>
                    <dd>Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</dd>
                    <dt><span class="keyword inline-code">const</span></dt>
                    <dd>Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).</p>
                <p>Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.</p>
                Some examples of legal names are <span class="variable inline-code">Number_hits</span>, <span class="variable inline-code">temp99</span>, <span class="variable inline-code">$credit</span>, and <span class="variable inline-code">_name</span>.

                <h3 id="declaring-variables">Declaring variables</h3>
                <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With the keyword <strong>var</strong>. For example, <span class="inline-code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">x</span> = 42</span>. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.</li>
                    <li> the keyword <strong>const</strong> or <strong>let</strong>. For example, <span class="inline-code"><span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="variable">y</span> = 13</span>. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope below.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can declare variables to unpack values from Object Literals using the Destructuring Assignment syntax. For example, <span class="inline-code"><span class="keyword">let</span> { <span class="variable">bar</span> } = <span class ="variable">foo</span></span>. This will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo. </p>
                <p>You can also assign a value to a variable For example, <span class="inline-code"><span class="variable">x</span> = 42</span>. This form creates an undeclared global variable. It also generates a strict JavaScript warning. Undeclared global variables can often lead to unexpected behavior. Thus, it is discouraged to use undeclared global variables.</p>

                <p>A variable declared using the <span class="keyword inline-code">var</span> or <span class="keyword inline-code">let</span> statement with no assigned value specified has the value of <span class="keyword inline-code">undefined</span>.</p>
                <p>An attempt to access an undeclared variable results in a ReferenceError exception being thrown:</p>

                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">a</span>;
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="string">'The value of a is '</span> + <span class="variable">a</span>); <span class="comment">// The value of a is undefined</span>

console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="string">'The value of b is '</span> + <span class="variable">b</span>); <span class="comment">// The value of b is undefined</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">b</span>;
<span class="comment">// This one may puzzle you until you read 'Variable hoisting' below</span>

console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="string">'The value of c is '</span> + <span class="variable">c</span>); <span class="comment">// Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined</span>

<span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="variable">x</span>;
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span  class="string">'The value of x is '</span> + <span class="variable">x</span>); <span class="comment">// The value of x is undefined</span>

console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="string">'The value of y is '</span> + <span class="variable">y</span>); <span class="comment">// Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="variable">y</span>;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>You can use undefined to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable input is not assigned a value, and the if statement evaluates to true.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">input</span>;
<span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="variable">input</span> === <span class="keyword">undefined</span>) {
    <span class="function">doThis</span>();
} 
<span class="keyword">else</span> {
    <span class="function">doThat</span>();
}</pre>
                </code>
                <p>The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context. For example, the following code executes the function myFunction because the myArray element is undefined:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">myArray</span> = [];
<span class="keyword">if</span> (!<span class="variable">myArray</span>[0]) <span class="function">myFunction</span>();</pre>
                </code>
                <p>The undefined value converts to NaN when used in numeric context.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">a</span>;
<span class="variable">a</span> + 2;  <span class="comment">// Evaluates to NaN</span></pre>
                </code>
                <p>When you evaluate a null variable, the null value behaves as 0 in numeric contexts and as false in boolean contexts. For example:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">n</span> = <span class="keyword">null</span>;
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="variable">n</span> * 32); <span class="comment">// Will log 0 to the console</span></pre>
                </code>
                
                <h3 id="variable-scope">Variable scope</h3>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                <p>JavaScript before <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script 2015 does not have block statement scope. Rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.</p>
                <p>For example, the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the global context (or the function context if the code is part of a function). The scope of x is not limited to the immediate if statement block.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="keyword">true</span>) {
    <span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">x</span> = 5;
}
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="variable">x</span>);  <span class="comment">// x is 5</span></pre>
                </code>
                <p>This behavior changes when using the let declaration (introduced in <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script 2015).</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="keyword">true</span>) {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="variable">y</span> = 5;
}
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="variable">y</span>);  <span class="comment">// ReferenceError: y is not defined</span></pre>
                </code>
                
                <h3 id="variable-hoisting">Variable hoisting</h3>
                <p>Another unusual thing about variables in JavaScript is that you can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception.</p>
                <p>This concept is known as hoisting. Variables in JavaScript are, in a sense, "hoisted" (or "lifted") to the top of the function or statement. However, variables that are hoisted return a value of undefined. So even if you declare and initialize after you use or refer to this variable, it still returns undefined.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">/**
 * Example 1
 */</span>
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="variable">x</span> === <span class="keyword">undefined</span>); <span class="comment">// true</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">x</span> = 3;

<span class="comment">/**
 * Example 2
 */
// will return a value of undefined</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">myvar</span> = <span class="string">'my value'</span>;

(<span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="variable">myvar</span>); <span class="comment">// undefined</span>
    <span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">myvar</span> = <span class="string">'local value'</span>;
})();</pre>
                </code>
                <p>The above examples will be interpreted the same as:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">/**
 * Example 1
 */</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">x</span>;
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="variable">x</span> === <span class="keyword">undefined</span>); <span class="comment">// true</span>
<span class="variable">x</span> = 3;

<span class="comment">/**
 * Example 2
 */</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">myvar</span> = <span class="string">'my value'</span>;

(<span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">myvar</span>;
    console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="variable">myvar</span>); <span class="comment">// undefined</span>
    <span class="variable">myvar</span> = <span class="string">'local value'</span>;
})();</pre>
                </code>
                <p>Because of hoisting, all var statements in a function should be placed as near to the top of the function as possible. This best practice increases the clarity of the code.</p>
                <p>In <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script 2015, let and const are hoisted but not initialized. Referencing the variable in the block before the variable declaration results in a ReferenceError, because the variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="variable">x</span>); <span class="comment">// ReferenceError</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="variable">x</span> = 3;</pre>
                </code>

                <h3 id="function-hoisting">Function hoisting</h3>
                <p>In the case of functions, only function declarations are hoisted—but not the function expressions.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">/* Function declaration */</span>

<span class="function">foo</span>(); <span class="comment">// "bar"</span>

<span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">foo</span>() {
    console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="string">'bar'</span>);
}

<span class="comment">/* Function expression */</span>

<span class="function">baz</span>(); <span class="comment">// TypeError: baz is not a function</span>

<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">baz</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
  console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="string">'bar2'</span>);
};</pre>
                </code>
                
                <h3 id="global-variables">Global variables</h3>
                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.</p>
                <p>In web pages, the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
                <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

                <h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the <span class="inline-code keyword">const</span> keyword.</p>
                <p>The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as any variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign ($), and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="variable">PI</span> = 3.14;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It must be initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block-scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR</span>
<span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">f</span>() {};
<span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="function">f</span> = 5;

<span class="comment">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO</span>
<span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">f</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="variable">g</span> = 5;
    <span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">g</span>;
    <span class="comment">//statements</span>
}</pre>
                </code>
                <p>However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">const</span> <span  class="variable">MY_OBJECT</span> = {<span class="string">'key'</span>: <span class="string">'value'</span>};
<span class="variable">MY_OBJECT</span>.<span class="variable">key</span> = <span class="string">'otherValue'</span>;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>Also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
<span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="variable">MY_ARRAY</span> = [<span class="string">'HTML'</span>,<span class="string">'CSS'</span>];
<span class="variable">MY_ARRAY</span>.<span class="function">push</span>(<span class="string">'JAVASCRIPT'</span>);
console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="variable">MY_ARRAY</span>); <span class="comment">//logs ['HTML','CSS','JAVASCRIPT'];</span></pre>
